Some python scripting projects (mostly web scrapping)


- mapIt uses webroweser module to open google maps and search location
    - To run -> python maIt.py 'path'

- web scrapping has 3 scripts:
    - Downloading_All_XKCD_Comics.py uses requests to download web page and beautifulSoup to parse specific image tag and save in hard disk from 'https://xkcd.com'.
    - opening_all_results.py use requests and beautifulSoup to open all top 5 search result links.
    - scrapping.py is simple scrapper I was testing.
